# DronetSim 

The repository provides a UAV simulator developed with the course "Project: Software-Defined Communications Systems" of MSc in Communications Engineer during the academic year 2022-23 by Andrea Cuzzi, Loredana Logruosso, Luca Nepote, supervised by prof. Paolo Giaccone and Dr. Francesco Raviglione.

The work has been motivated by __Flagship project__ **Space4You** within **NODES** project, which has received funding from the __MUR – Missione 4__, Componente 2, Investimento 1.5 – Creazione e rafforzamento di “**Ecosistemi dell’innovazione**”, costruzione di “leader territoriali di R&S” – del PNRR with grant agreement no. ECS00000036.

The UAV simulator is aimed at investigating a basic scenario in which generic airborn vehicles move in a given area and communicate within a multihop fashion. The simulation model captures many aspects:
